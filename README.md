# Cute Sway Recorder

Screen recorder for [`wlroots`](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots)-based window managers, mainly Sway

More specifically, this project is merely a graphical [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) wrapper for
[`wf-recorder`](https://github.com/ammen99/wf-recorder), leveraging
[`slurp`](https://github.com/emersion/slurp) for selecting screen regions.
